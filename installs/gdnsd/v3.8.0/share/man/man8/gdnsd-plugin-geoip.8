.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgdnsd-plugin-geoip\fR uses MaxMind's GeoIP2 binary databases to
map address and \s-1CNAME\s0 results based on geography and
monitored service availability.  It fully supports both
IPv6 and the emerging edns-client-subnet standard.  If a request
contains the edns-client-subnet option with a source netmask greater
than zero, the edns-client-subnet information will be used instead
of the source \s-1IP\s0 of the request (the \s-1IP\s0 of the querying cache).
.PP
It supports the GeoIP2 format databases, which typically end in \fI.mmdb\fR.  It
does not supports the legacy GeoIP1 format databases (which typically end in
\&\fI.dat\fR).
.PP
It can also be used with no GeoIP database at all, in which case the only
network-mapping input comes from the \f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR config data or an external
\&\f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR file, which explicitly map subnets to datacenter lists.
.PP
This plugin can operate in an automatic distance-based mode (using a City-level
database's coordinate information) It can also operate coordinate-free and rely
on the user to configure a hierarchical map of cascading default
user-location-to-datacenter mappings, starting at the continent level.
.PP
The two modes can also be effectively mixed at geographic boundaries.
.PP
For each \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR you define (which maps geographic location codes to
preference-ordered lists of your datacenter locations), this plugin merges
all of the raw GeoIP subnets into the largest possible supernets which
contain identical responses in your configuration.  These in turn are used
to set larger edns-client-subnet scope masks than you'd see simply
returning raw GeoIP results.
.SH "PLUGIN_METAFO"
.IX Header "PLUGIN_METAFO"
The documentation for \fBgdnsd\-plugin\-metafo\fR\|(8) is required reading for
understanding the geoip plugin documentation here.  The geoip plugin is an
exact superset of the metafo plugin, and re-uses almost all of the metafo
plugin's source code.  Metafo does failover along a single, global, ordered
list of datacenters.  What plugin_geoip adds on top of the functionality
of metafo is the ability to have the order of the datacenter failover list
become dynamic per-request based on geographic hints derived from the
client's network address.
.SH "FILE LOCATIONS"
.IX Header "FILE LOCATIONS"
The configuration of this plugin can reference several external
configuration and/or data files.  By default, all files referenced in
this plugin's configuration are loaded from the \fIgeoip\fR subdirectory
of the daemon's configuration directory (default \fI/root/.asdf/installs/gdnsd/v3.8.0/etc/gdnsd\fR).
You can load from other locations by specifying absolute file paths.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- TOP-LEVEL"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - TOP-LEVEL"
The top level of the geoip plugin's configuration (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`plugins => {
geoip => { ... } }\*(C'\fR) supports only three explicit keys.  One is the
optional setting \f(CW\*(C`undefined_datacenters_ok\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The other two are required and expanded upon in detail in the next two
sections: \f(CW\*(C`maps\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`resources\*(C'\fR.  The \f(CW\*(C`maps\*(C'\fR section defines one or more
named mappings of location information from GeoIP binary databases to ordered
subsets of datacenter names.  The \f(CW\*(C`resources\*(C'\fR section defines one or more
named resources, each of which references one of the named maps and resolves
datacenter names to specific sets of addresses or CNAMEs.
.PP
Any other keys present at this level will be inherited down inside of each
per-resource hash inside the \f(CW\*(C`resources\*(C'\fR stanza, acting as per-resource
defaults for anything not defined explicitly there.
.ie n .SS """undefined_datacenters_ok = false"""
.el .SS "\f(CWundefined_datacenters_ok = false\fP"
.IX Subsection "undefined_datacenters_ok = false"
Boolean, default false.  If set to true, geoip resources are allowed to leave
some of the datacenters specified in their \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR undefined in their
resource-level \f(CW\*(C`dcmap\*(C'\fR.  For example, a map M might define 3 datacenters
named A, B, and C, but a resource using map M might only define result
addresses for datacenters B and C in its \f(CW\*(C`dcmap\*(C'\fR.  This would otherwise be a
hard configuration error.
.PP
\&\fB!!! \s-1DANGER\s0 !!!\fR \- Setting this value to true is a good way to shoot yourself
in the foot if you're not very careful about how your maps and resources are
configured with respect to each other, especially in \*(L"City Auto Mode\*(R".  Maps
are calculated without any knowledge of the resources that use them.  If a
specific network or location maps to a list of datacenters which contains none
of the defined datacenters for a given resource, the results of runtime
queries for that resource from that location or network will be the empty set
(no answer records at all).  This is virtually guaranteed to happen in \*(L"City
Auto Mode\*(R" if the number of undefined datacenters in a resource is greater
than or equal to the map's \f(CW\*(C`auto_dc_limit\*(C'\fR.
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- MAPS"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - MAPS"
All \f(CW\*(C`maps\*(C'\fR\-level configuration keys are the names of the maps you
choose to define.  A map, conceptually, is a mapping between geography
and/or network topology to varying ordered datacenter sub-sets.  The value
of each named map must be a hash, and the following configuration keys
apply within:
.ie n .SS """geoip2_db = GeoIP2\-City.mmdb"""
.el .SS "\f(CWgeoip2_db = GeoIP2\-City.mmdb\fP"
.IX Subsection "geoip2_db = GeoIP2-City.mmdb"
String, filename, optional.  This is the filename of a MaxMind GeoIP2 format
database.  It should contain either the City or Country data model.  There is
no distinction made here for the \s-1IP\s0 version, and it is normal for these
databases to contain both IPv4 and IPv6 data together.  If one or the other is
missing, clients using that address family will be defaulted.
.ie n .SS """datacenters = [ one, two, three, ... ]"""
.el .SS "\f(CWdatacenters = [ one, two, three, ... ]\fP"
.IX Subsection "datacenters = [ one, two, three, ... ]"
Array of strings, required.  This is the total set of datacenter names used
by this map.  You must define at least one datacenter name (although 2 or
more would be infinitely more useful).  At this time, there is a maximum
limit of 254 datacenter names per map, although this could be raised if
anyone requires it.  The order specified here is the fallback default
result ordering in various default cases (e.g. if no explicit top-level map
default list is given).
.ie n .SS """ignore_ecs = true"""
.el .SS "\f(CWignore_ecs = true\fP"
.IX Subsection "ignore_ecs = true"
Boolean, default false.  If this is set to \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR, all resources using
this map will ignore \s-1EDNS\s0 Client Subnet (\s-1ECS\s0) information when
performing lookups against the map, relying solely on the \s-1DNS\s0 source \s-1IP\s0
for the lookup.  If the client provided \s-1ECS\s0 in such a query, the
response will also contain the \s-1ECS\s0 option to signal that we're \s-1ECS\s0 aware
in general, but the response scope mask will be set to zero to signal
the cache that the \s-1ECS\s0 data wasn't used and the result is globally
cacheable.
.PP
This is useful for situations in which the map is intentionally meant to
operate solely on recursor IPs rather than \s-1ECS\s0 IPs, but other maps
serviced by the same authserver do make use of \s-1ECS\s0 data, and thus the
global \fBedns_client_subnet\fR config option can't be used to disable
handling the option completely for the whole server.
.ie n .SS """nets = { ... }"""
.el .SS "\f(CWnets = { ... }\fP"
.IX Subsection "nets = { ... }"
Key-value hash, optional (see below for alternate form).  If specified, the
contents should be key-value pairs of \f(CW\*(C`network/netmask\*(C'\fR mapped to a
datacenter name (or an array of datacenter names).  Any
network-to-datacenter mappings specified here will override mappings
determined via GeoIP.  Note that it is illegal to specify networks in the
IPv4\-like subspaces of IPv6 other than v4compat, but it is legal to specify
actual IPv4 networks (which are treated identically to v4compat).  See the
section on IPv4 Compatible Addresses later in this document for more
details.  The order of the networks is unimportant; they will always be
sorted and inserted such that an entry which is a subnet of another entry
is not obliterated by the parent supernet.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    nets => {
\&        10.0.0.0/8 => [ dc1, dc2 ],
\&        192.0.2.128/25 => dc3
\&        2001:DB8::/32 => [ dc4, dc5, dc6 ],
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
In the case that one entry is a subnet of another with a different result
dclist, the entries are merged correctly such that the supernet surrounds
the subnet.  In the case of an exact duplicate entry (or an effective one,
after merging smaller subnets) with a different dclist, it is arbitrary
which one \*(L"wins\*(R" and the condition is warned about.  If you care about
this case, you should sanitize your nets data beforehand with an external
tool and/or parse for the warning message in log outputs.
.ie n .SS """nets = nets_file_name"""
.el .SS "\f(CWnets = nets_file_name\fP"
.IX Subsection "nets = nets_file_name"
String pathname, optional.  A variant of the above, but the contents of the
key-value hash are loaded from the named external file.  This makes life
easier for external tools and scripts generating large sets of nets entries
(e.g. from \s-1BGP\s0 data).  The file will be monitored for changes and reloaded
at runtime much like the GeoIP databases.
.ie n .SS """map = { ... }"""
.el .SS "\f(CWmap = { ... }\fP"
.IX Subsection "map = { ... }"
Key-value hash, optional.  This is the heart of a named map which uses
GeoIP: the map itself, which maps places to ordered lists of datacenters.
It requires \f(CW\*(C`geoip2_db\*(C'\fR is also specified, and makes no sense without it.
.PP
This is a nested key-value hash.  At each level, the keys are location
codes (continent, country, region/subdivision, or city information depending
on depth), and the values are either an ordered datacenter array (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`[
dc03, dc01, dc04 ]\*(C'\fR), or a sub-hash containing a deeper level of distinction.
At each layer, a special key named \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR is available, which sets the
default for everything within the current scope.  The top-level default itself
defaults to the ordered list from \f(CW\*(C`datacenters\*(C'\fR in the normal case.  If
the entire \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR stanza is missing or empty, you just get the default
behavior of \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR.  A datacenter array can also be empty, which
implies that this location is mapped to receive no response data (the
server will still respond to the query, and will not issue an \s-1NXDOMAIN.\s0  It
will simply be a \s-1NODATA/NOERROR\s0 response like you'd get if there were no
records of this type, but could be records of other types for the same
name).
.SS "GeoIP2 Location Data Hierarchy"
.IX Subsection "GeoIP2 Location Data Hierarchy"
The top level of the map hierarchy is comprised of MaxMind's seven
continent codes: \f(CW\*(C`AF\*(C'\fR for Africa, \f(CW\*(C`AS\*(C'\fR for Asia, \f(CW\*(C`NA\*(C'\fR for North America,
\&\f(CW\*(C`SA\*(C'\fR for South America, \f(CW\*(C`EU\*(C'\fR for Europe, \f(CW\*(C`OC\*(C'\fR for Oceania, and \f(CW\*(C`AN\*(C'\fR for
Antarctica.  The next level is the \s-1ISO 3166\-1\s0 2\-letter country code.
.PP
From here there are a number of Subdivision levels, the count of which varies
for different network database entries.  In the \s-1US,\s0 for example, there is only
one level of subdivision data for the \s-1US\s0 States.  In the Czech
Republic there are two levels of subdivision: first into 14 regions, and then
further into 91 districts.  Subdivisions are all specified using their
\&\s-1ISO 3166\-2\s0 codes directly.
.PP
After all subdivision levels, the final level is the City level.  The City
names are all in the \s-1UTF\-8\s0 character set.  Currently this plugin only uses the
English city names from the database, even though other languages may be
available depending on the database.
.PP
As a pragmatic answer to the issues that can arise with multiple subdivision
layers, the map automatically searches deeper in the database data when no map
match is found at a given level of the map hierarchy beneath the Country level.
This means you can skip over any levels of Subdivision detail in your map that
are irrelevant to you.
.PP
For example, this targets the New Zealand regional council subdivision of
Otago without explicitly specifying the enclosing subdivision for the South
Island:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { OC => { NZ => { OTA => [...] } } }
.Ve
.PP
As another example, this works correctly for targeting the city of Paris
without caring about what layers of subdivisions lie between it and \s-1FR:\s0
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  { EU => { FR => { Paris => [...] } } }
.Ve
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- MAPS \- CITY AUTO MODE"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - MAPS - CITY AUTO MODE"
\&\*(L"City-auto-mode\*(R" is a special mode of operation that automatically maps out
the world to your datacenters based on coordinate math, so that you don't
have to manually construct a complex hierarchical \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR.  It can still be
mixed with \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR of course, allowing you to use auto-mode for only select
geographic areas if you wish (or disabling it for select areas by
specifying manual lists).  The key parameter is \f(CW\*(C`auto_dc_coords\*(C'\fR, which
enables city-auto-mode.  This requires a City-level GeoIP2 database; the
Country ones don't contain coordinate information.
.ie n .IP """auto_dc_coords = { ... }""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWauto_dc_coords = { ... }\fR" 4
.IX Item "auto_dc_coords = { ... }"
Key-value hash, optional.  If this option is specified, the whole map's
basic mode of operation changes to \*(L"city-auto-mode\*(R".  The contents of the
hash are a key for each datacenter named in \f(CW\*(C`datacenters\*(C'\fR, with their
values set to an array of \f(CW\*(C`[lat, lon]\*(C'\fR in decimal degree units.  When
city-auto-mode is enabled by this, the following configuration-validation
changes occur from the default, static-mapping mode: the loaded GeoIP2
database(s) are required be City-level databases, and the special keyword
\&\f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR becomes a legal \*(L"datacenter list\*(R" in the \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR stanza.
.Sp
With city-auto-mode enabled, the top-level map \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR defaults to
\&\f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR, but can be overridden with a manual list.  For any location that
maps to \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR, the coordinates specified here in \f(CW\*(C`auto_dc_coords\*(C'\fR will
be compared with the coordinates from the City-level database(s) to
determine an automatic distance-sorted datacenter list.
.Sp
If you omit one or more defined datacenters from the coordinate list in
\&\f(CW\*(C`auto_dc_coords\*(C'\fR, those datacenters will not be used in automatic results,
but will still be available for manual use via \f(CW\*(C`map\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR
entries.
.ie n .IP """auto_dc_limit = N""" 4
.el .IP "\f(CWauto_dc_limit = N\fR" 4
.IX Item "auto_dc_limit = N"
Unsigned integer, optional, default 3.  When city-auto-mode is in effect,
this is the upper length limit for auto-generated lists.  3 is a reasonable
default even if you have a considerably longer set of datacenters, as this
provides a primary as well as two fallbacks.  Raising this to a large
number in the presence of a long datacenter list will cause the set of
unique result datacenter lists to increase rapidly, and thus reduce the
optimization of the final result database for edns-client-subnet purposes.
It's really not worth raising this value in almost any case, unless you
really need to handle more than 3 random datacenters going offline at the
same time and still have clients fail elsewhere.  The value zero is treated
as unlimited (highly un-recommended).
.PP
Under city-auto-mode, when the top-level default is (explicitly or
implicitly) \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR, there is still a fallback static ordering which is the
whole ordered \f(CW\*(C`datacenters\*(C'\fR list, which is the normal static default
\&\f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR when not in city-auto-mode.  This fallback is used when no
location information is available at all (e.g. IPv6 client vs IPv4 GeoIP
\&\s-1DB,\s0 Anonymous Proxies, etc).
.SH "MAP TESTING"
.IX Header "MAP TESTING"
A binary program \f(CW\*(C`gdnsd_geoip_test\*(C'\fR is included.  This can be used
directly from the commandline, parses the relevant bits of your gdnsd
config file for geoip map info, and then provides datacenter list results
for \s-1IP\s0 address + map combinations supplied by the user.  Useful for
debugging your maps and testing the mapping of client IPs.  It has a
separate manpage \fBgdnsd_geoip_test\fR\|(1).
.SH "CONFIGURATION \- RESOURCES"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION - RESOURCES"
Resource-level configuration within the \f(CW\*(C`resources\*(C'\fR stanza is nearly
identical to the resources configuration of the metafo plugin, with all of
the same basic behaviors about synthesizing or directly referencing the
configuration of other plugins per-datacenter.
.PP
One difference is that metafo's per-resource \f(CW\*(C`datacenters\*(C'\fR array is replaced
with \f(CW\*(C`map => mapname\*(C'\fR, which references one of the maps defined in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`maps\*(C'\fR stanza, described in detail earlier.  The set of defined datacenters in
the \f(CW\*(C`dcmap\*(C'\fR stanza must match the total set of datacenters defined by the
referenced map, unless \f(CW\*(C`undefined_datacenters_ok\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`true\*(C'\fR (see
warnings and documentation above).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`skip_first\*(C'\fR flag can also be set per resource, and is much more useful
with the geoip plugin than it is with the basic metafo plugin.  If this flag is
set, the first datacenter in the failover list for a given lookup will be
skipped, allowing the definition of a \*(L"second choice\*(R" resource using the same
basic map definition as the first choice.  In this case the original first
choice is *never* a possible answer, and the rest of the logic (e.g. skipping
datacenters marked as down) proceeds as normal with the remaining list.  If the
map entry and/or the resource definition have already reduced the effective
datacenter count to one, the flag has no effect.
.SH "META-PLUGIN INTERACTION"
.IX Header "META-PLUGIN INTERACTION"
Both of the meta-plugins (\f(CW\*(C`metafo\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`geoip\*(C'\fR) can reference their own
as well as each others' resources by direct reference within a \f(CW\*(C`dcmap\*(C'\fR, so
long as a resource does not directly refer to itself.  This allows
plugin-layering configurations such as geoip \-> metafo \-> weighted, or
metafo \-> geoip \-> multifo, or even metafo \-> metafo \-> simplefo, etc.
.PP
Bear in mind that once you begin using inter-meta-plugin references, you
could create a reference loop.  gdnsd does not currently detect or prevent
such loops, and they will cause complete runtime failure when queried,
probably by running out of stack space during recursion.
.PP
Additionally, \f(CW\*(C`geoip\*(C'\fR can synthesize configuration for \f(CW\*(C`metafo\*(C'\fR
resources, but the reverse does not hold; \f(CW\*(C`metafo\*(C'\fR cannot synthesize
configuration for \f(CW\*(C`geoip\*(C'\fR resources.
.SH "IPv4 Compatible Addresses"
.IX Header "IPv4 Compatible Addresses"
This plugin knows of six different relatively-trivial ways to map IPv4
addresses into the IPv6 address space.  These are shown below in as much
detail matters to this plugin, with \f(CW\*(C`NNNN:NNNN\*(C'\fR in place of the copied
IPv4 address bytes:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&         ::0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 \- v4compat (deprecated)
\&         ::ffff:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 4291 \- v4mapped
\&    ::ffff:0000:NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 2765 \- SIIT (obsoleted)
\&       64:ff9b::NNNN:NNNN/96   # RFC 6052 \- Well\-Known Prefix
\&    2001:0000:X:NNNN:NNNN/32   # RFC 4380 \- Teredo (IPv4 bits are flipped)
\&           2002:NNNN:NNNN::/16 # RFC 3056 \- 6to4
\&
\&    (in the Teredo case above, "X" represents some variable non\-zero bytes
\&     that occupy the center 64 bits of the address).
.Ve
.PP
All of this plugin's internal lookup databases are IPv6 databases, and any
IPv4\-like information is always stored in the v4compat space within these
databases.  When doing runtime lookups all other v4\-like addresses (raw
IPv4 addresses, v4mapped, \s-1SIIT, WKP,\s0 Teredo, and 6to4) are converted to the
canonical v4compat IPv6 representation before querying the internal
databases.  The other representations (v4mapped, \s-1SIIT, WKP,\s0 Teredo, 6to4) are
Undefined internally, and will never be referenced at lookup-time due to
the v4compat conversion mentioned earlier.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR stanza is not allowed to specify entries in the five undefined
v4\-like IPv6 spaces (those other than v4compat).  Specify those networks as
normal IPv4 networks or v4compat networks instead.  Legitimate IPv6 \f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR
entries which happen to be a supernet of any v4\-like spaces will *not*
unduly affect v4\-like lookups.  There is no functional difference between
v4compat and native v4 forms in \f(CW\*(C`nets\*(C'\fR, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`192.0.2.0/24\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`::C000:0200/120\*(C'\fR are completely identical.
.PP
GeoIP databases that are natively IPv4\-only get all of their data loaded
into the v4compat space only.  For normal IPv6 GeoIP databases, by default we
load the v4compat space directly (which is where MaxMind stores IPv4 data in
their IPv6 databases), but ignore the v4mapped/SIIT/Teredo/6to4 spaces
(some of which are empty in MaxMind's databases, and some of which simply
alias the v4compat space).
