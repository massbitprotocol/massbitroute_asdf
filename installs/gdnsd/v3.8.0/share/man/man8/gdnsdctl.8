.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBgdnsdctl\fR is the canonical control socket client for \fBgdnsd\fR.  All
operations described above are synchronous and report success by exiting with
exit status zero, or failure by non-zero.
.PP
In general gdnsd and gdnsdctl support concurrent execution of disparate actions
from multiple actors against a single daemon, and everything should eventually
faithfully report success without any bugs caused by races, if there are no
other issues.
.PP
That is to say, for example, things should be reliable if your configuration
management is routinely executing \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl replace\*(C'\fR for configuration
updates, and another tool is independently routinely executing \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl
reload\-zones\*(C'\fR as it updates zonefile data, while a third set of tooling is
doing \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl acme\-dns\-01\*(C'\fR commands, even if all 3 commands collide with
near-perfect timing.  Eventually all 3 \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl\*(C'\fR commands will exit, and the
resulting state will have all of the configuration, zone data, and challenge
updates.
.PP
This is also true of multiple independent and overlapping executions of the
same action, such as multiple \f(CW\*(C`reload\-zones\*(C'\fR requests proceeding in parallel,
or multiple \f(CW\*(C`acme\-dns\-01\*(C'\fR requests.
.SH "COMMANDLINE OPTION FLAGS"
.IX Header "COMMANDLINE OPTION FLAGS"
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Set the configuration directory, defaults to \fI/root/.asdf/installs/gdnsd/v3.8.0/etc/gdnsd\fR.  This
is used to find the main daemon's configuration file and parse it, in case it
sets a non-default \f(CW\*(C`run_dir\*(C'\fR, which would change the location of the daemon's
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 control socket path.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
This tells gdnsdctl to connect to the daemon over a \s-1TCP\s0 control socket instead
of the usual local \s-1UNIX\s0 domain socket.  See the \fBgdnsd.config\fR\|(5) docs about
\&\f(CW\*(C`tcp_control\*(C'\fR for more information about configuring the server side of this.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
Enables additional debug-level log output as appropriate.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l"
Sends log output to syslog rather than the default stderr.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Sets the timeout in seconds (default 47) for the entire execution.  This is
enforced via a process-level \s-1SIGALRM\s0 timer, but it can run slightly over time
in corner cases.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o"
One-shot mode.  Normally, gdnsdctl will persistently retry to execute the
action under soft failure conditions.  The soft failure conditions happen when
the daemon is in the midst of a \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR operation, or when a communications
error occurs after the connection is initially established (which could be the
racy result of catching bad timing with the old daemon shutting down during a
\&\f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR operation).  This disables the retries and upgrades all soft
(retryable) errors to hard (immediately-fatal) errors.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Ignore-dead-daemon mode.  Normally, all actions fail if no daemon is currently
running.  With this flag set, if the daemon is not currently running, but the
action is one of the limited set where the intent would be accurately reflected
by a future start of the daemon, gdnsdctl will return a successful exit value
in spite of the lack of a running daemon.
.Sp
The set of commands which currently honor \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR are: \f(CW\*(C`reload\-zones\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`stop\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`acme\-dns\-01\-flush\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR.
.SH "Actions"
.IX Header "Actions"
.IP "\fBstop\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop"
Synchronously stops the running daemon.  Exit status zero means the daemon was
observed to stop as commanded.
.Sp
With \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR, exit status zero can also mean the daemon was already not running,
which makes \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl \-i stop\*(C'\fR an idempotent stop.
.IP "\fBreload-zones\fR" 4
.IX Item "reload-zones"
Synchronously reloads the daemon's zonefiles.  Exit status zero indicates the
operation completed successfully and the new data is visible to clients.
.Sp
With \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR, exit status zero can also mean the daemon was not running (if it's
started in the future, the recently-updated zonefiles would be in effect).
.IP "\fBreplace\fR" 4
.IX Item "replace"
Asks the running daemon to spawn a replacement instance of itself.  This can be
used for daemon code upgrades and/or configuration changes.  The \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR
sequence is intended to have minimal operational impact from most points of
view: it's race-free, requests are not lost or dropped and there is no pause in
processing requests.  Stats data is handed off seamlessly from the old instance
to the new one, as is any ephemeral \s-1ACME DNS\-01\s0 challenge data.  The control
socket remains available for new connections at all times, but the actual
processing of new connections is delayed for a short span of time.
.Sp
Commands from already-connected control socket clients (like gdnsdctl) can be
denied with a soft failure response during critical time windows of the replace
sequence, but gdnsdctl will wait and retry them afterwards.
.Sp
The replacement daemon is initially executed as a child of the running daemon
and thus inherits many attributes of its execution environment.  The old and
new daemons coordinate a handoff process over an inter-daemon control socket
connection.  The handoff process does its best to ensure that if the new daemon
fails at any stage of startup, the old daemon can continue operations as it was
before.
.Sp
\&\s-1DNS\s0 listening sockets are handed off in an overlapped fashion: there will be a
brief window of time where client requests can be routed to either daemon
randomly, but there should never be a window where service is unavailable.  The
control socket itself is handed off synchronously: the old daemon stops
accepting new connections before the new daemon begins accepting them, and the
old daemon re-starts accepting if the new daemon fails to succeed completely.
.Sp
Once the old daemon claims the replacement process was successful, gdnsdctl
will monitor the old daemon's exit and then make a fresh connection to the
control socket of the new daemon and check its status.  If all of this is
successful, the replace command will finally exit with status zero.  It will
exit with a non-zero status if any part of this operation fails for any reason,
which should in most conceivable cases leave the existing daemon fully
functional.
.Sp
All other daemon-state-changing gdnsdctl operations (anything but the readonly
actions \*(L"status\*(R", \*(L"stats\*(R", and \*(L"states\*(R") which might be initiated separately
and concurrently are explicitly blocked by the daemon while the critical
part of the replace handoff sequence is in progress.  gdnsdctl will, by
default, retry an action repeatedly until the replace finishes and lets the
action through or it reaches the \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR timeout.  The \f(CW\*(C`\-o\*(C'\fR flag disables these
retries, which will cause the state-changing gdnsdctl actions to immediately
fail during the critical replace window.
.Sp
Normally, this command will fail if there is no running daemon.  However, with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR, exit status zero can also mean the daemon was not running (if it's
started in the future, the recently-updated configuration or binary that
triggered wanting to execute the \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR request would then be in effect).
.Sp
The retry system works for \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR vs \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR as well: if you
concurrently execute several \f(CW\*(C`gdnsdctl replace\*(C'\fR commands, one will proceed
first and the rest will wait in retry loops to each take their turn replacing
the daemon serially until they've all done so successfully, unless their
gdnsdctl \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR timeout expires first (each new daemon will take some time to
start, depending on the zonefile count and configuration complexity).
.IP "\fBstatus\fR" 4
.IX Item "status"
Checks the running daemon's status, reporting its \s-1PID\s0 and version to stderr.
.IP "\fBstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "stats"
Dumps \s-1JSON\s0 statistics from the running daemon to stdout.
.IP "\fBstates\fR" 4
.IX Item "states"
Dumps \s-1JSON\s0 monitored states from any configured service health monitors.
.IP "\fBacme\-dns\-01\fR" 4
.IX Item "acme-dns-01"
Injects temporary \s-1ACME DNS\-01\s0 challenge response payloads as defined by
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft\-ietf\-acme\-acme\-14> into the running daemon.
This is intended for integration with scripts or services which generate signed
certificates from an ACME-capable certificate authority.
.Sp
Two or more additional commandline arguments are required, in pairs of \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`payload\*(C'\fR, where \f(CW\*(C`name\*(C'\fR is a valid domainname and \f(CW\*(C`payload\*(C'\fR is the
challenge response payload (which, as a \s-1SHA\-256\s0 output encoded in base64url
encoding, should be 43 bytes long and consist of only alphanumeric characters
plus \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\*(C'\fR).  A maximum of 100 separate payloads can be specified in a
single gdnsdctl invocation.
.Sp
This example...
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    gdnsdctl acme\-dns\-01 example.org 0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012 www.example.org ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\-abcdefghijklmnop
.Ve
.Sp
\&... causes the daemon to temporarily respond to \f(CW\*(C`TXT\*(C'\fR requests for the name
\&\f(CW\*(C`_acme\-challenge.example.org.\*(C'\fR with the first payload above, and similarly
with the second payload for \f(CW\*(C`_acme\-challenge.www.example.org.\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Challenge payload responses injected by this command automatically expire after
a short time.  The default is 10 minutes, and is configurable via the config
option \f(CW\*(C`acme_challenge_ttl\*(C'\fR.  The actual \s-1DNS TTL\s0 emitted with the \f(CW\*(C`TXT\*(C'\fR
responses defaults to zero (which is highly recommended!) and is controlled by
the separate option \f(CW\*(C`acme_challenge_dns_ttl\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Injecting responses for domainnames that are not within the scope of one of the
statically-configured zones will succeed, but the response to such queries will
still be \f(CW\*(C`REFUSED\*(C'\fR (until such a zone later appears, if ever).
.Sp
If more than one payload is configured for a given name (in the same command,
or in separate commands less than the \s-1TTL\s0 window apart), multiple \s-1TXT\s0 records
will be emitted.  If there is any statically-configured \s-1TXT\s0 data from zonefiles
at a conflicting \f(CW\*(C`_acme\-challenge\*(C'\fR name, the static \s-1TXT\s0 RRs will also be
served alongside any data from this mechanism.
.Sp
As an implementail detail (quirk?) of this mechanism, any static zonefile RRs
which have a first label of \f(CW\*(C`_acme\-challenge\*(C'\fR will automatically have their
TTLs forced to the \f(CW\*(C`acme_challenge_dns_ttl\*(C'\fR regardless of the \s-1TTL\s0 specified in
the zonefile.  This was the easiest way to ensure that we never serve mixed \s-1TTL\s0
values in a single RR-set of \s-1TXT\s0 records, which is forbidden by \s-1RFC 2181.\s0
.Sp
The data injected by this mechanism persists through daemon \f(CW\*(C`replace\*(C'\fR
operations, but not through a full \f(CW\*(C`stop\*(C'\fR of the daemon.  It also persists
through zone data reloads, and in the case that data is injected for a
non-existent zone which then comes into existence through a reload, the
challenge will begin working after the reload.
.IP "\fBacme\-dns\-01\-flush\fR" 4
.IX Item "acme-dns-01-flush"
Immediately flushes all injected payload data from above ahead of its natural
expiry.  Mostly useful for testing or for clearing up mistakes, but some
integrations with spiky large volumes of challenges may wish to flush data
explicitly at points in time when there are no outstanding \s-1DNS\-01\s0 challenges.
.Sp
This is another command that honors the \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR flag: if \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR is specified and
the daemon is not running, this command will report success, as a dead daemon
has no challenge data to flush.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.IX Header "EXIT STATUS"
In general, all operations exit with status zero if and only if the operation
is successful.  Errors and most other output go to stderr, except in the case
of \s-1JSON\s0 data dumps, which go to stdout.
