.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This is the primary zonefile syntax for \fBgdnsd\fR\|(8).  The syntax is
designed to be as close as possible to the standard zonefile
syntax from \s-1RFC 1035\s0 (which is the \*(L"standard\*(R" format one
typically sees with traditional \s-1BIND\s0 servers).  This document will
just cover a few important highlights and/or deviations from the norm.
.SH "DIRECTIVES"
.IX Header "DIRECTIVES"
The standard \f(CW$TTL\fR, \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR, and \f(CW$INCLUDE\fR directives
are supported with their normal syntax and semantics:
.PP
\&\f(CW$TTL\fR changes the default \s-1TTL\s0 of any records coming after it,
and can occur multiple times.  Note that in the absence of a
zonefile-level \f(CW$TTL\fR setting, the default \s-1TTL\s0 comes from the
global config option \f(CW\*(C`zones_default_ttl\*(C'\fR, which in turn defaults
to \f(CW86400\fR (1 day).
.PP
\&\f(CW$ORIGIN\fR changes what is appended to unqualified hostnames
(those lacking a final \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR) seen in the zone file from that
point forward, as well as any \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR entries (which is an alias
for the current origin).  \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR itself may also be an unqualified
name, in which case the previous origin is appended to it.
Any fully-qualified \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR must be within the zone described
by this zonefile.  The default origin is the zone name itself.
.PP
\&\f(CW$INCLUDE\fR includes another file as if its contents existed
at the point of the \f(CW$INCLUDE\fR directive.  Include directives
may specify an optional origin, which has the same effect
as \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR at the top of the included file.  Changes to
the origin (and default ttl) within included files have no
effect on the outer file.
.PP
\&\s-1BIND\s0's \f(CW$GENERATE\fR extension is not supported at this time, but
there's no fundamental reason it couldn't be added at a later
date.
.SH "SPECIAL NAMES AND ORIGINS"
.IX Header "SPECIAL NAMES AND ORIGINS"
The standard \f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, as a whole name, is supported as an alias for the current
origin.  In addition to this, gdnsd implements two special extensions \f(CW@Z\fR and
\&\f(CW@F\fR.  These denote the current zone name, and the original origin (before any
internal \f(CW$ORIGIN\fR declarations) of the file currently being parsed.  Unlike
\&\f(CW\*(C`@\*(C'\fR, they can also be used as the final label of an unqualified name.  \f(CW@Z\fR
and \f(CW@F\fR will always be equivalent to each other in the main zonefile for a
zone, but may differ when parsing included files from \*(L"$INCLUDE\*(R".  As an example:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&    * zones/example.org has the line "$INCLUDE includes/foo foo"
\&    * zones/includes/foo has these lines:
\&       $ORIGIN bar
\&       asdf A 192.0.2.1
\&       $ORIGIN baz.@F
\&       asdf A 192.0.2.2
\&       $ORIGIN quux.@Z
\&       asdf A 192.0.2.3
\&    * This results in creating all of these:
\&       asdf.bar.foo.example.org A 192.0.2.1
\&       asdf.baz.foo.example.org A 192.0.2.2
\&       asdf.quux.example.org    A 192.0.2.3
.Ve
.PP
Note that the origin changes accomplished with \f(CW@F\fR and \f(CW@Z\fR backtrack
towards the root of the name hierarchy, and thus wouldn't normally be possible
without explicitly using the zone name itself.  The main benefit of these
directives is they allow this kind of origin-switching behavior while keeping
all zone data relative to the zone name rather than absolute.  When combined
with the fact that the zones scanner will load symlinks, this means the above
\&\fIzones/example.org\fR could also be symlinked as \fIzones/example.com\fR, loading
all the same files and providing an identical tree of data under the other zone
name without conflict.
.SH "SUPPORTED RESOURCE RECORD TYPES"
.IX Header "SUPPORTED RESOURCE RECORD TYPES"
All RRs must be of class \f(CW\*(C`IN\*(C'\fR, which is the implicit default.
.PP
\&\fBgdnsd\fR\|(8) supports the following standard \s-1RR\s0 types with their
standard \s-1RDATA\s0 formats:
.PP
traditional: \s-1SOA, A, AAAA, NS, PTR, CNAME, MX, SRV, TXT, NAPTR\s0
non-traditional: \s-1CAA\s0
explicitly unsupported: \s-1HINFO\s0
.PP
It also supports the generic format for unknown \s-1RR\s0 types documented
in \s-1RFC 3597,\s0 which has syntax like:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  foo TYPE31337 \e# 10 0123456789 ABCDEF0123
.Ve
.PP
\&... which indicates an \s-1RR\s0 of numeric type 31337 containing
10 bytes of \s-1RDATA,\s0 specified as the final part of the \s-1RR\s0 as
a pair of 5\-byte hex strings.  See \s-1RFC 3597\s0 itself for full
details.
.PP
gdnsd does not allow using the \s-1RFC3597\s0 format to specify any of the supported
traditional standard \s-1RR\s0 types, but it can be used to encode data for the
non-traditional types.  It's also not allowed to use \s-1RFC3597\s0 to specify \s-1HINFO\s0
RRs, as these are now reserved in gdnsd for use in handling \f(CW\*(C`ANY\*(C'\fR queries,
using the \s-1RFC 8482 HINFO\s0 option.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`SOA\*(C'\fR records' negative-caching \s-1TTL\s0 is set to the minimum of the traditional
\&\*(L"minimum\*(R" (last) field (which always means \*(L"negative cache \s-1TTL\*(R"\s0 as of \s-1RFC
2308\s0), and the actual \s-1TTL\s0 of the \s-1SOA\s0 record itself.  This \s-1TTL\s0 is used as the
actual \s-1TTL\s0 of the \s-1SOA\s0 record any time it is emitted, whether for negative or
positive answers.
.PP
Additionally, gdnsd supports two special-case, non-standard
virtual resource record types \s-1DYNA\s0 and \s-1DYNC:\s0
.SS "\s-1DYNA\s0"
.IX Subsection "DYNA"
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR is for dynamically-determined address records (both A
and \s-1AAAA\s0) via plugin code.  The right-hand-side of a \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR
\&\s-1RR\s0 is a plugin name and a resource name separated by an exclamation
mark.  The named plugin will be fed the resource name and
the \s-1DNS\s0 client's \s-1IP\s0 address and/or edns-client-subnet information,
and it is up to the plugin code which addresses of which types
to return in the response.
.PP
The dynamic plugin lookup for \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR will be used anywhere that
regular \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR and/or \f(CW\*(C`AAAA\*(C'\fR records would be used.  \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR cannot
co-exist with actual static A or \s-1AAAA\s0 records at the same name, but can
co-exist with any other RR-type.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DYNAAAA\*(C'\fR RRs \fBcannot\fR be used to supply the addresses of
nameservers.  In other words, any name that exists in zone scope on the
right-hand-side of an \f(CW\*(C`NS\*(C'\fR record cannot have \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`DYNAAAA\*(C'\fR
(and relatedly, must have at least one of \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`AAAA\*(C'\fR).
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&  ; asks plugin \*(Aqgeoip\*(Aq to provide address data from
\&  ;  its resource named \*(Aqpubwww\*(Aq for address queries.
\&  foo DYNA geoip!pubwww
\&  foo MX 10 mail
.Ve
.SS "\s-1DYNC\s0"
.IX Subsection "DYNC"
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR has the same syntax as \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR above, but different data
rules.  Plugins results returned via \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR can be either addresses
or a \f(CW\*(C`CNAME\*(C'\fR record.  \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR cannot co-exist with \fBany\fR other
resource record at the same name, much like normal \f(CW\*(C`CNAME\*(C'\fR RRs.
This also implies that \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR cannot be used at the zone root,
as the zone root requires \f(CW\*(C`NS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`SOA\*(C'\fR RRs.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR's dynamic \s-1CNAME\s0 targets cannot be used to point at names in the same
zonefile as the \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR record; they must be used to point at other zones.
.PP
Example:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&  ; asks plugin \*(Aqgeoip\*(Aq to provide address data or a CNAME
\&  ;  (at the plugin\*(Aqs discretion) for its resource named
\&  ;  \*(Aqwww\*(Aq.  No other RRs of any type for name \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq are
\&  ;  legal alongside this record.
\&  foo DYNC geoip!www
.Ve
.SS "\s-1DYNA/DYNC\s0 TTLs"
.IX Subsection "DYNA/DYNC TTLs"
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR \s-1TTL\s0 fields have a syntax extension and slightly
different meanings than the \s-1TTL\s0 field of a traditional, fixed \s-1RR.\s0
The format for \s-1DYNA/DYNC\s0 TTLs is \f(CW\*(C`MAX[/MIN]\*(C'\fR, with \f(CW\*(C`MIN\*(C'\fR defaulting
to half of \f(CW\*(C`MAX\*(C'\fR if not specified explicitly.
.PP
Based on the configuration and state of the underlying monitored services,
(see \*(L"service_types\*(R" in \fBgdnsd.config\fR\|(8)), gdnsd knows the minimum time
to the next possible state-change which could affect a given \f(CW\*(C`DYNA\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`DYNC\*(C'\fR result.  For example, given the configuration and state, it may
be known that in order for a currently \f(CW\*(C`DOWN\*(C'\fR address to transition to
the \f(CW\*(C`UP\*(C'\fR state (and thus change the answer to a given query) would require
7 more successful monitoring checks in a row at 8\-second intervals, and
therefore cannot happen in less than 56 seconds.  In this case 56 seconds
would be the internally-calculated \s-1TTL.\s0
.PP
In cases where multiple monitored resources factor into a plugin's
decision and/or response (e.g. multifo), the calculated \s-1TTL\s0 will generally
be the minimum of all involved internal monitoring TTLs.  This calculated
\&\s-1TTL\s0 is then clamped to the \f(CW\*(C`MAX\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MIN\*(C'\fR limits from the zonefile.
.PP
Examples:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    ; Explicit range of 30 \- 300:
\&    www 300/30 DYNC weighted!foo
\&    ; Implicit range of 150 \- 300:
\&    www 300 DYNA metafo!myservice
\&    ; Avoid all TTL\-mangling and use a fixed value of 10 minutes:
\&    www 600/600 DYNA geoip!foo\-dist
.Ve
.SS "\s-1TXT\s0 data auto-splitting"
.IX Subsection "TXT data auto-splitting"
gdnsd's \f(CW\*(C`TXT\*(C'\fR RRs support the auto-splitting
of long string constants.  Rather than manually breaking the
data into 255\-byte chunks as required by the protocol, you can
specify a single long chunk and have the server break it at
255 byte boundaries automatically.  (this behavior can be
disabled via \fBgdnsd.config\fR\|(5) as well, which will turn
oversized chunks into zonefile parsing errors).
.PP
\&\s-1TXT\s0 records are limited to a maximum of 16000 bytes when encoded in rdata form
for wire transmission.
